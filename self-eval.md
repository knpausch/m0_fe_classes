# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I feel I did well. I utilized notes, asked questions and researched topics to help with my learning. I learned to embrace productive struggle and to not stress too hard.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It is good. I make sure to take needed breaks or continue working if I'm on a roll. I know when to stop and continue so I have a fresh mind the next day. I am consistent on being on top my assignments before their due date.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to finish setting up my desk. I should move my iMac somewhere else so I can use my full desk space. I might need a better chair and external mouse/keyboard.
